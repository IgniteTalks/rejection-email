#### Ignite speaker submission - rejection letter

_Once your Ignite gets more popular you'll probably find that you have more applicants than speaking slots. It's never nice telling people that they've been unsuccessful - here is an email you could use to let them down gently:_

>
> Hi there,
> 
> Thanks so much for submitting a proposal to speak at Ignite XYZ. We've been  overwhelmed by the number and the quality of all of the submissions.
> 
> Unfortunately, there has to be a cutoff point and we can't showcase all of the ideas submitted, so we can't go ahead with your talk at Ignite XYZ #123.
> 
> Thanks again for your contribution, and we hope that you can still come along on the night - there's a ticket in your name on the guest list by way of saying thanks.
> 
> The Ignite XYZ team
>
